/// XDR panel, which makes WindowServer raise the physical backlight toward its HDR maximum — and,
/// to keep SDR content looking unchanged, digitally attenuate it by the same ratio (visible as
/// `NSScreen.maximumExtendedDynamicRangeColorComponentValue` ramping above 1). Second, the app
/// scales the display's gamma transfer table up by the boost this policy computes, mapping the
/// attenuated SDR white back toward full drive of the raised backlight — the whole desktop gets
/// genuinely brighter. Table entries saturate at 1.0, so anything the boost pushes past the clip
/// point flattens: HDR content looks clipped while a boost is engaged (the same limitation other
/// XDR unlockers document), which is why the boost never exceeds the backlight's real ratio.
